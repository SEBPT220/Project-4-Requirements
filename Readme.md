## Task

Your task is to build a full-stack `Postresql/Django/Python` application with a functioning backend and frontend. **No User Auth is necessary for this project**.
Try to think about building an application that will create an engaging user experience and be creative in your concept.

## For Project Approval

- Detailed ReadMe (Name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used)
- Full Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the backend
- Trello Board that tells the development story of your app
- Wireframes of the front end
- Project must be _well-scoped_, meaning that you can capably reach MVP by the due date

## Project Approval Due Date: Tuesday, August 6th @ 8:30 PM PDT

## Project Requirements (MVP)

**Your project must:**


- Be a **realistic idea**. It cannot be anything we've created in class. It also cannot be from an online tutorial or walkthrough.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **ReadMe.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)).
- Your ReadMe should have your group members names, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- Include a minimum of 3 Django Models (models).
- At least one `1 to MANY` or `MANY to MANY` association.
- Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice).
- Deployed online.

## Project Due Date: Saturday, August 10th @ 11:00AM PDT

## Post-MVP Ideas

- Integrate a 3rd party API: [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- Integrate a UI Library (Semantic, Material-UI, React-MD, react-rainbow, r-suite)
- Integrate Mapbox or Geolocation: [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/)
- Implement Data Visualization or Charting: [here](https://dev.to/giteden/top-5-react-chart-libraries-for-2020-1amb)

## Tips

- Research what you consider the best websites out there to get ideas/inspiration.
- Commit early (day one) and often (everytime you implement a new feature).
- Implement all project requirements first before moving on to post-mvp features.
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase on your portfolio - it could land you a job).

## A Note on Plagiarism

- Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for immediate withdrawal.
- You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and Stack Overflow for help. However, it is <b><i>not acceptable to copy</i></b> another persons code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.
- Small snippets of code that solve small problems taken from Stack Overflow are generally an exception to this rule. If you aren't sure, it is your responsibility to <b><i>ask your instructor</i></b>. To be on the safe side, we ask that you credit the person/resource you got the code from in a comment, and let an instructor take a look at it.# Project-4-Requirements
